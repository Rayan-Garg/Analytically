# Analytically 

Analytically is a modern EHR App that aims to reduce physician's documentation times by reducing documentation difficulty and integrating artificial intelligence. In the long term, Analytically aims to convert doctor-patient conversations to text, generate summarizations, and carry out actions dependent on the conversations(such as billing, etc.).
